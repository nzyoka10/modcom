# Kotlin Programming

Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It is fully interoperable with Java and is widely used for Android app development, backend development, and more.

## Key Features of Kotlin
- **Concise**: Reduces boilerplate code compared to Java.
- **Safe**: Null safety is built into the type system.
- **Interoperable**: Works seamlessly with existing Java code.
- **Functional**: Supports functional programming paradigms.
