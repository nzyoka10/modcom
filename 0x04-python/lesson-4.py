# Python tuples
# A tuple - is an ordered, immutable collection of items.

'''
    Key Characteristics of Tuples
        1. Ordered: The items in a tuple have a defined order, which means that you can access them using their index (starting from 0).
        2. Immutable: Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements. This is in contrast to lists, which are mutable.
        3. Heterogeneous: A tuple can contain elements of different data types.
        4. Can be Nested: Tuples can contain other tuples as elements.
